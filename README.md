# Alexa Skill Insulin Wiserer

**Abstract**
*Ever since first attempts to create artificially intelligent conversational systems were made to Chatbots, the idea of invigorating a natural human-computer interaction has been a topic of interest that attracts much attention, given rapid advancements in natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Stemming from this goal, Conversational Agents (CAs) are probably the most well-known research area in the context of Information Systems (IS) that adopts anthropomorphic features to enable systems to understand and deliver human-like responses. The application of CAs can be divided into cooperative and competitive settings: while the former principally serve benefits of the service provider, the latter represents an intrinsic motivation towards assisting the user. By conducting a systematic literature review across 8 domains, we make contributions to research in IS by bringing together disparate streams of work on CAs, denoting the distinctions between cooperative and competitive CAs as well as providing implications for future research in this area.*

*During my seminar "Information Systems", my team of 4 members developed this Alexa Healthcare Skill that aims at helping people with diabetes to keep track of and calculate their individual amount of insulin dose, based on their insulin corrector factor, carbohydrate/insulin ratio, current blood sugar level and the amount of extra carbohydrates they are about to take in. This is especially helpful for people with poor memory or those who are often unsure about their exact insulin dose.*
