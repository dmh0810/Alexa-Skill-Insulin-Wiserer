# Alexa Skill Insulin Wiserer

During my seminar "Information Systems", my team of 4 members developed this Alexa Healthcare Skill that aims at helping people with diabetes to keep track of and calculate their individual amount of insulin dose, based on their insulin corrector factor, carbohydrate/insulin ratio, current blood sugar level and the amount of extra carbohydrates they are about to take in. This is especially helpful for people with poor memory or those who are often unsure about their exact insulin dose.
